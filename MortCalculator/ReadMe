This is a simple Mortgage calculator app I recreated in python (the original is in java). 
When run, it creates a GUI that allows user input.

Enter the principle, term and interest rate of the mortgage and click the Calculate button. 
This will output a breakdown of your repayments and the total cost of the loan.

As this is a simple version, there is no error handling.
