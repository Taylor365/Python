This is a CoderDojo Project between myself and 3 students.

The Project is a text based RPG in which the player moves from town to town completing quests, fighting monsters and clearing dungeons.

There are 4 different characters to choose from, different weapons to buy, sell and earn through quests.

Once all dungeons are cleared, the player has won... but if the player dies, that's gameover!

TODO:

1 - Get skills working<br />
2 - Integrate items<br />
3 - Refine shopping system<br />
4 - Balance
